**A Decision Tree Explained**

A Decision tree is a supervised machine-learning method that helps make predictions or categorizations. A Decision tree is a non-parametric model, meaning it does not require a specification of parameters, and as a result, it can provide a greater number of possible outcomes. Leveraging PiML will allow Data Scientists to quickly implement a Decision Tree model which are one of the most popular learning algorithms among data scientists, for their accuracy, interpretability, and versatility. 

**Key Terms of a Decision Tree**

*Root Node - This is the first node of a decision tree, from where all splitting will occur, similar to a tree’s roots.

*Splitting - The process of splitting a single node into many nodes. For example, a categorical node could be split into night or day, or land or sea.

*Decision/Internal Nodes - When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, it's a decision node.

*Leaf Node - When a sub-node cannot be split further it is called a leaf or terminal node. 

*Branch - These are the connections between nodes, each branch represents the outcome of each test from the decision node to the respective leaf node.

*Parent/Child Node - A child node is the subnode of a decision node. Every decision node is a parent node. For example, a body of water would be a parent node, whereas, seas, oceans, lakes, rivers, and waterfalls, would be child nodes.

**Example:**

To begin a user must typically complete the following tasks: Open Google Colab, Data loading, preparation, and exploration. Below, we will run through how to train a decision tree model using a sample California Housing dataset. (Note: You can use any clean dataset under 10 megabytes of size)

**Step 1:** 
Install PiML in Google Colab
